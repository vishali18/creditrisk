# Lending Club Data Credit Risk Analysis - Predicting Defaults
# Introduction
  For this project I chose a dataset from Lending Club approved personal loans between 2007 and 2011. The data can be found on www.lendingclub.com. The purpose of the analysis is to improve profitability and help the company and investors determine interest rates. We will use machine learning models to model credit risk as a binary classification problem.
